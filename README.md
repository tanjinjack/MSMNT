# MSMNT
Multiple-geometry Simplified Modified Nordtest Method, as proposed in Chang Liu's thesis: https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/in-situ-characterization-of-the-acoustic-impedance-of-vegetated-r

For most purposes, you'll only need to work with "MSMNT_main.m". You do not need to change anything in any other files (unless you know exactly what you are doing). All scripts are, IMO, well-commented. Take some time to read them to help you to understand the codes.

To be implemented: 2-layer MSMNT.

Disclaimer: This is a complete rewrite of Chang Liu's algorithm, that is aimed to be more efficient and more expandable to cope with more complex problems.
