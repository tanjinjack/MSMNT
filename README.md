# MSMNT
Multiple-geometry Simplified Modified Nordtest Method, as proposed in Chang Liu's thesis: https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/in-situ-characterization-of-the-acoustic-impedance-of-vegetated-r

For most purposes, you'll only need to work with "MSMNT.m". You do not need to change anything in any other files (unless you know exactly what you are doing).

To be implemented
2-layer: MSMNT.
